# Overview
A train is approaching a split in the tracks: on its straight-away path, there are 5 people, and on the left track, there is only one.
You're the only one able to switch a lever that would divert the cart left to the single person saving the 5.
Do you let fate run its course? Or, do you intervene to sacrifice the one for the many?
This is the thought experiment known as the [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).
You can have long conversations about this moral dilemma, but what will you do if you were put to the test?

## Scene
I put my Phil 101 class to the test.
I superimposed the faces of six of my classmates on the tracks and had a student volunteer decide as the train barreled down the tracks.

## Image Usage
- An indefinite number of images can be used to represent the faces of the characters (both the switch operator and the people on the tracks)
- This project, for example, used class roster images, which are not included in source control for privacy reasons
